# First-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Jose Silva, a passionate junior developer showcasing my skills and projects. This portfolio is a glimpse into my journey, demonstrating my dedication to fullstack development.

My portfolio includes basic html, css, and javascript.

I provided links which navigate to an about me page, a portfolio page with different projects that I've completed, and a contact page where you can reach out to me about any inquiries.

My Contacts page includes my e-mail and my LinkedIn page.
